Q47: No the balance does not change when there is an error message it stays 0.I predict that
 there will still be a errorif I enter 0 as the parameter.I ended up being right about it.
 
 
 Q48: I predict that it will allow us to insert $0.It infact did not let me insert $0,
 it showed me the same error as last time (use positive amount rather than ...).
 
 It's behaviour changed,when I insert an amount less or equal to 0,it shows an error
 on the output in my terminal window (use positive amount rather than ...)
 When I try to insert an amount greater than 0,it does not show up on my output.
 
 
 
 Q50: The boolean was isVisible,and yes it was well suited because it is either 
 visible or invisible.


 
 
 Q51: 
 The price is included in the total to ensure that only the required
 amount for one ticket is accounted for.It is then deducted from 
 the balance so that the final charge reflects just the cost of a single ticket
 
 
 
 Q52: Yes the code still compiles with no errors.Nothing happened because the else statement no longer tells you 
 that I need to insert more money.
 
 
 
 Q53: No it can't because we always have to insert
 a positive amount greater than $0.
 
 
 
 Q55:
 saving = price * discount; 
 
 
 
 Q56: mean= total / count
