Q47: No the balance does not change when there is an error message it stays 0.I predict that
 there will still be a errorif I enter 0 as the parameter.I ended up being right about it.
 
 
 Q48: I predict that it will allow us to insert $0.It infact did not let me insert $0,
 it showed me the same error as last time (use positive amount rather than ...).
 
 It's behaviour changed,when I insert an amount less or equal to 0,it shows an error
 on the output in my terminal window (use positive amount rather than ...)
 When I try to insert an amount greater than 0,it does not show up on my output.
 
 
 
 Q50: The boolean was isVisible,and yes it was well suited because it is either 
 visible or invisible.
